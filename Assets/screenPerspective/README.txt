Avoid RenderTextures when outputting to a real display, as their performance cost is huge, especially for multiple displays.

Since your setup is different than mine (screen size and position) you can either view the scene "ScreensPerspectiveVirtual3MonitorsDemo" or adjust "ScreensPerspectiveReal3MonitorsDemo" to match your setup.

To better understand what is happening, it is great to have the windows Scene and Game visible at the same time.
You can move the Game camera using right click and wasd in "NoTracker" scenes.
